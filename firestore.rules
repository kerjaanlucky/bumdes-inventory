/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a multi-tenant security model where each 'branch'
 * acts as a distinct tenant. A user's permissions are strictly scoped to the branch they
 * are assigned to. The rules differentiate between two roles within a branch: 'admin' and 'user'.
 * Admins have full control over their branch's data, while regular users have read-only access.
 *
 * Data Structure: All application data is hierarchically organized under the top-level
 * '/branches' collection. Each branch document contains subcollections for its associated
 * users, items, stock, purchases, and sales (e.g., /branches/{branchId}/items/{itemId}).
 * This structure provides a clear and secure boundary between different branches.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Branch-Scoped Access: A user authenticated for Branch A cannot read, write, or list
 *   data from Branch B. All access checks verify the user's membership and role within
 *   the target branch.
 * - Role-Based Permissions: Branch admins are granted full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)
 *   permissions on all data within their branch. Standard users are restricted to read-only
 *   permissions for most data.
 * - Client-Side Branch Creation Disabled: To ensure administrative control, the creation
 *   of new branches is disallowed from the client. This operation must be performed through a
 *   trusted server-side environment.
 * - User Listing Restricted: Only branch admins can list the users within their branch.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: To ensure fast and efficient authorization, the `branchId`
 * is denormalized (copied) onto every document within a branch's subcollections (e.g., items,
 * sales). This avoids slow and costly `get()` calls to parent documents and allows rules
 * to make authorization decisions based on the document's own data. User roles are checked
 * by performing a single `get()` on the requesting user's profile document within the target branch.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: The use of distinct collections per branch (/branches/{branchId})
 * inherently segregates data, ensuring that queries for one branch's data cannot accidentally
 * leak data from another.
